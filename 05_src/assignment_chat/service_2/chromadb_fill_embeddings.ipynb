       " 'Air Quality Index\\nWhy is air quality \\nimportant?\\nLocal air quality affects how \\nyou live and breathe. Like \\nthe weather, it can change \\nfrom day to day or even \\nhour to hour. The U.S. \\nEnvironmental Protection \\nAgency (EPA) and your \\nlocal air quality agency \\nhave been working to make \\ninformation about outdoor \\nair quality as easy to find \\nand understand as weather \\nforecasts. A key tool in this \\neffort is the Air Quality Index, or AQI. EPA and local offi-\\ncials use the AQI to provide simple information about your \\nlocal air quality, how unhealthy air may affect you, and how \\nyou can protect your health.\\nWhat is the AQI? \\nThe AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells \\nyou how clean or unhealthy your air is, and what associ-\\nated health effects might be a concern. The AQI focuses on \\nhealth effects you may experience within a few hours or days \\nafter breathing unhealthy air. The AQI is calculated for four \\nmajor air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-\\nlevel ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur \\ndioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established \\nnational air quality standards to protect public health.\\nEPA is currently reviewing the national air quality standard \\nfor nitrogen dioxide.   If the standard is revised, the AQI \\nwill be revised as well.  \\nAir quality directly affects our quality \\nof life.\\nHow does the AQI work? \\nThink of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. \\nThe higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pol-\\nlution and the greater the health concern. For example, an \\nAQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little or no \\npotential to affect public health, while an AQI value over \\n300 represents air quality so hazardous that everyone may \\nexperience serious effects. \\nAn AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air \\nquality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set \\nto protect public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally',\n",
       " 'An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air \\nquality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set \\nto protect public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally \\nthought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air \\nquality is considered to be unhealthy—at first for certain sensitive \\ngroups of people, then for everyone as AQI values increase.\\nWhat do the AQI values mean?\\nThe purpose of the AQI is to help you understand what local \\nair quality means to your health. T o make it easier to under-\\nstand, the AQI is divided into six levels of health concern:\\nAir Quality Index  \\n(AQI) Values\\nLevels of \\nHealth Concern\\nColors\\nWhen the AQI is in \\nthis range:\\n...air quality \\nconditions are:\\n...as symbolized \\nby this color:\\n0 to 50 Good Green\\n51 to 100 Moderate Yellow\\n101 to 150 Unhealthy for \\nSensitive Groups Orange\\n151 to 200 Unhealthy Red\\n201 to 300 Very Unhealthy Purple\\n301 to 500 Hazardous Maroon\\n2',\n",
       " 'Air Quality Index\\nEach category corresponds to a different level of health concern: \\n•\\t Good. The AQI value for your community is between  \\n0 and 50. Air quality is satisfactory and poses little or no \\nhealth risk. \\n•\\t Moderate. The AQI is between 51 and 100. Air quality \\nis acceptable; however, pollution in this range may pose a \\nmoderate health concern for a very small number of indi-\\nviduals. People who are unusually sensitive to ozone or \\nparticle pollution may experience respiratory symptoms. \\n•\\t\\nUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups. When AQI values \\nare between 101 and 150, members of sensitive groups \\nmay experience health effects, but the general public is \\nunlikely to be affected. \\n•\\t Ozone: People with lung disease, children, older adults, \\nand people who are active outdoors are considered \\nsensitive and therefore at greater risk.\\n•\\t Particle pollution: People with heart or lung disease, \\nolder adults,\\n1 and children are considered sensitive and \\ntherefore at greater risk.\\n•\\t Unhealthy. Everyone may begin to experience health effects \\nwhen AQI values are between 151 and 200. Members of \\nsensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. \\n•\\t\\nVery Unhealthy. AQI values between 201 and 300 \\ntrigger a health alert, meaning everyone may experience \\nmore serious health effects. \\n•\\t\\nHazardous. AQI values over 300 trigger health warnings \\nof emergency conditions. The entire population is even \\nmore likely to be affected by serious health effects. \\nHow is a community’ s AQI calculated  \\nand reported? \\nEach day, monitors record concentrations of the major pol-\\nlutants at more than a thousand locations across the country. \\n1 D ue to the normal aging process, older adults may experience increased \\nhealth risks from exposure to unhealthy air. Studies indicate that some \\npeople become more sensitive in their mid-60s. However, the risk of \\nheart attacks, and thus the risk from particle pollution, may begin as \\nearly as the mid-40s for men and mid-50s for women.',\n",

However, the risk of \\nheart attacks, and thus the risk from particle pollution, may begin as \\nearly as the mid-40s for men and mid-50s for women.\\nThese raw measurements are converted into a separate AQI \\nvalue for each pollutant (ground-level ozone, particle pollu-\\ntion, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide) using standard \\nformulas developed by EPA. The highest of these AQI values \\nis reported as the AQI value for that day.\\n2\\nIn large cities (more than 350,000 people), state and local \\nagencies are required to report the AQI to the public daily. \\nMany smaller communities also report the AQI as a public \\nhealth service.\\nWhen the AQI is above 100, agencies must also report \\nwhich groups, such as children or people with asthma or \\nheart disease, may be sensitive to that pollutant. If two or \\nmore pollutants have AQI values above 100 on a given day, \\nagencies must report all the groups that are sensitive to those \\npollutants. For example, if a community’s AQI is 130 for \\nozone and 101 for particle pollution, the AQI value for that \\nday would be announced as 130 for ozone. The announce-\\nments would note that particle pollution levels were also \\nhigh and would alert groups sensitive to ozone or particle \\npollution about how to protect their health.\\nMany cities also provide forecasts for the next day’s AQI. \\nThese forecasts help local residents protect their health by \\nalerting them to plan their strenuous outdoor activities for a \\ntime when air quality is better.\\n2 F or more information on how the AQI is calculated, see “T echnical \\nAssistance Document for the Reporting of Daily Air Quality—the Air \\nQuality Index (AQI)” in the “Publications” section of www.airnow.gov.\\nChildren active outdoors can be sensitive to air pollutants. \\n3',\n",

       " 'Air Quality Index\\nHow can I avoid being exposed to \\nunhealthy air? \\nYou can take simple steps to reduce your exposure to \\nunhealthy air. First, you need to find out whether AQI levels \\nare a concern in your area. You can do this, as described \\npreviously, by visiting the AIRNow Web site, signing up for \\nEnviroFlash, or checking your local media. If the AQI for \\nozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, or sulfur dioxide \\nis a concern in your area, you can learn what steps to take to \\nprotect your health by checking the charts on the following \\npages. T wo important terms you will need to understand are:   \\n•\\t\\nProlonged exertion. This means any outdoor activity that \\nyou’ll be doing intermittently for several hours and that \\nmakes you breathe slightly harder than normal. A good \\nexample of this is working in the yard for part of a day. \\nWhen air quality is unhealthy, you can protect your health \\nby reducing how much time you spend on this type of \\nactivity. \\n•\\t\\nHeavy exertion. This means intense outdoor activi-\\nties that cause you to breathe hard. When air quality \\nis unhealthy, you can protect your health by reducing \\nhow much time you spend on this type of activity, or by \\nsubstituting a less intense activity—for example, go for a \\nwalk instead of a jog. Be sure to reduce your activity level \\nif you experience any unusual coughing, chest discom-\\nfort, wheezing, breathing difficulty, or unusual fatigue. \\nWhat is ozone? \\nOzone is a gas found in the air we breathe.

       " 'Air Quality Index\\nsuLFur dIoxIde\\nWhat is sulfur dioxide? \\nSulfur dioxide, a colorless, reactive gas, is produced when \\nsulfur-containing fuels such as coal and oil are burned. \\nGenerally, the highest levels of sulfur dioxide are found near \\nlarge industrial complexes. Major sources include power \\nplants, refineries, and industrial boilers.\\nWhat are the health effects and who is \\nmost at risk? \\nSulfur dioxide is an irritant gas that is removed by the nasal \\npassages. Moderate activity levels that trigger mouth breath-\\ning, such as a brisk walk, are needed for sulfur dioxide to \\ncause health effects in most people.\\n•\\t People with asthma who are physically active outdoors \\nare most likely to experience the health effects of sulfur \\ndioxide. The main effect, even with very brief exposure \\n(minutes), is a narrowing of the airways (called bron-\\nchoconstriction). This may be accompanied by wheez-\\ning, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, which \\nmay require use of medication that opens the airways. \\nSymptoms increase as sulfur dioxide levels or breathing \\nrate increases. When exposure to sulfur dioxide ceases, \\nlung function typically returns to normal within an hour, \\neven without medication. \\n•\\t At very high levels, sulfur dioxide may cause wheezing, \\nchest tightness, and shortness of breath even in healthy \\npeople who do not have asthma. \\n•\\t Long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide may cause respira-\\ntory symptoms and illness, and aggravate asthma. People \\nwith asthma are the most susceptible to sulfur dioxide. \\nHowever, people with other chronic lung diseases or car-\\ndiovascular disease, as well as children and older adults, \\nmay also be susceptible to these effects.\\nHow can I protect my health at different \\nAQI values?\\n* An A QI of 100 for sulfur dioxide corresponds to a level of 75 parts per bil-\\nlion (averaged over one hour).\\nAQI Value Actions to Protect Your Health \\nFrom \\nsulfur \\ndio\\nxide\\nGood  \\n(0–50) None\\nModerate \\n(51–100*) None\\nUnhealthy for \\nSensitive Groups',\n",
