AQI values at or below 100 are generally \\nthought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air \\nquality is considered to be unhealthy—at first for certain sensitive \\ngroups of people, then for everyone as AQI values increase.\\nWhat do the AQI values mean?\\nThe purpose of the AQI is to help you understand what local \\nair quality means to your health. T o make it easier to under-\\nstand, the AQI is divided into six levels of health concern:\\nAir Quality Index  \\n(AQI) Values\\nLevels of \\nHealth Concern\\nColors\\nWhen the AQI is in \\nthis range:\\n...air quality \\nconditions are:\\n...as symbolized \\nby this color:\\n0 to 50 Good Green\\n51 to 100 Moderate Yellow\\n101 to 150 Unhealthy for \\nSensitive Groups Orange\\n151 to 200 Unhealthy Red\\n201 to 300 Very Unhealthy Purple\\n301 to 500 Hazardous Maroon\\n2',\n",
       "   'Air Quality Index\\nWhy is air quality \\nimportant?\\nLocal air quality affects how \\nyou live and breathe. Like \\nthe weather, it can change \\nfrom day to day or even \\nhour to hour. The U.S. \\nEnvironmental Protection \\nAgency (EPA) and your \\nlocal air quality agency \\nhave been working to make \\ninformation about outdoor \\nair quality as easy to find \\nand understand as weather \\nforecasts. A key tool in this \\neffort is the Air Quality Index, or AQI. EPA and local offi-\\ncials use the AQI to provide simple information about your \\nlocal air quality, how unhealthy air may affect you, and how \\nyou can protect your health.\\nWhat is the AQI? \\nThe AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells \\nyou how clean or unhealthy your air is, and what associ-\\nated health effects might be a concern. The AQI focuses on \\nhealth effects you may experience within a few hours or days \\nafter breathing unhealthy air. The AQI is calculated for four \\nmajor air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-\\nlevel ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur \\ndioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established \\nnational air quality standards to protect public health.\\nEPA is currently reviewing the national air quality standard \\nfor nitrogen dioxide.   If the standard is revised, the AQI \\nwill be revised as well.  \\nAir quality directly affects our quality \\nof life.\\nHow does the AQI work? \\nThink of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. \\nThe higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pol-\\nlution and the greater the health concern. For example, an \\nAQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little or no \\npotential to affect public health, while an AQI value over \\n300 represents air quality so hazardous that everyone may \\nexperience serious effects. \\nAn AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air \\nquality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set \\nto protect public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally'],\n",

Ozone pollution is more likely to form dur-\\ning warmer months. This is when the weather conditions \\nnormally needed to form ground-level ozone—lots of \\nsun—occur. \\nWho is most at risk? \\nSeveral groups of people are particularly sensitive to ozone, \\nespecially when they are active outdoors. This is because ozone \\nlevels are higher outdoors, and physical activity causes faster \\nand deeper breathing, drawing more ozone into the body.\\n•\\t\\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic \\nbronchitis, and emphysema, can be particularly sensitive \\nto ozone. They will generally experience more serious \\nhealth effects at lower levels. Ozone can aggravate their \\ndiseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and \\nemergency room visits, and hospital admissions.\\n•\\t\\nChildren, including teenagers, are at higher risk from ozone \\nexposure because they often play outdoors in warmer weather \\nwhen ozone levels are higher, they are more likely to have \\nasthma (which may be aggravated by ozone exposure), and \\ntheir lungs are still developing.\\n•\\t\\nOlder adults may be more affected by ozone exposure, \\npossibly because they are more likely to have pre-existing \\nlung disease.\\nozone \\nHeavy exertion means an intense activity that causes you to breathe hard.\\n5',\n",
